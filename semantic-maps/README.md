Using scene context information has been proven beneficial in enhancing trajectory prediction models. To facilitate this, the SiT dataset offers multi-layered semantic maps that encompass a wide range of scene information.
The semantic maps are generated through a two-step process. Initially, point cloud maps are constructed, followed by manual segmentation using the <a href="https://github.com/hatem-darweesh/assuremappingtools">ASSURE mapping tools</a>. 
We prodive multi-layered semantic maps in PNG and Json formats.
